Project Repository:

The exploration of numerical Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset involves the application of diverse machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Linear Regression, and Cross-validation. The primary aim is to analyze and forecast AQI values accurately based on input parameters.

Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm, are employed to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the dataset. In the context of AQI prediction, SVM can discern complex patterns and relationships among input features, contributing to accurate forecasting.

Decision Tree Regression (DTR) is another technique applied in this analysis. It operates by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure. DTR is effective for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions among the input parameters, making it suitable for forecasting AQI values.

Linear Regression is utilized to model the linear relationship between input features and AQI values. This technique assumes a linear correlation and aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual AQI values. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the relationships between variables.

Cross-validation techniques are implemented to assess the model's performance and generalization capabilities. Cross-validation involves partitioning the dataset into subsets for training and testing, ensuring robust evaluation metrics and mitigating overfitting issues. This step is crucial for obtaining reliable and unbiased performance estimates.

For feature selection, a Heatmap is employed to visualize the correlation between different input parameters and the AQI values. This aids in identifying the most relevant features that significantly contribute to accurate AQI forecasting. Feature selection is vital for enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.

The overarching goal of this analysis is to identify the most reliable combination of machine learning techniques and input parameters capable of accurately forecasting AQI values. By leveraging the strengths of SVM, DTR, Linear Regression, and incorporating robust evaluation methods, the study aims to contribute to the development of effective models for predicting air quality, with potential applications in environmental monitoring and public health.
